# Project Description:

In the "fintech_app_getx" project, we have implemented advanced UI customization using Flutter's [MaterialStateProperty] and [ButtonStyle] to enhance the appearance and functionality of the [ElevatedButton] widget.

## UI Customization:

We have utilized the [MaterialStateProperty](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialStateProperty-class.html) class to create dynamic and interactive button styles. This allows us to define different button appearances based on various states, such as normal, hovered, focused, pressed, and disabled. By doing so, we have achieved a visually appealing and user-friendly button design that responds to user interactions in an intuitive manner.

Moreover, the [ButtonStyle](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ButtonStyle-class.html) class has been employed to encapsulate the visual properties of the [ElevatedButton](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ElevatedButton-class.html). This approach enables us to separate the button's appearance from its behavior, enhancing code modularity and maintainability. With [ButtonStyle](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ButtonStyle-class.html), we can easily define properties like text color, background color, padding, and shape, ensuring a consistent and polished UI throughout the app.

## Architecture and State Management:

For managing the app's state, we have opted for the Getx framework, which offers powerful state management capabilities. Our architecture follows the GETX Architectural Pattern, a derivative of the [MVC] (Model-View-Controller) with some features of [MVVC] (Model-View-ViewModel-Controller) pattern. This architecture promotes separation of concerns and modularization of code, leading to a more organized and maintainable project structure.

## Pattern for Designing Framework Studies
- [Prototype](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype) Creational Patterns
- [Builder](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder) Creational Patterns 
- [Singleton](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton) Creational Patterns 

## Dependency Injection (DI):

Dependency Injection (DI) plays a crucial role in our project, contributing to its scalability and testability. We have leveraged Getx's built-in dependency injection mechanism using the "binding" concept. By binding dependencies to specific routes or views, we ensure that the required dependencies are available when and where they are needed. This promotes a cleaner and more efficient codebase while facilitating the management of dependencies throughout the app.

In summary, the "fintech_app_getx" project showcases the integration of advanced UI customization techniques using [MaterialStateProperty] and [ButtonStyle]. The app's architecture adheres to the GETX Structurer Design Pattern, utilizing the power of Getx for state management and Dependency Injection. This combination of technologies results in a feature-rich and well-structured fintech application that provides a seamless and engaging user experience.

Certainly! Here's a "Getting Started" guide for setting up the development environment for Flutter and Getx in your "fintech_app_getx" project:

# Getting Started with Flutter and Getx

## Prerequisites:

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Flutter SDK:** Install the Flutter SDK by following the instructions on the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

2. **Dart SDK:** Flutter uses Dart as its programming language. Make sure you have the Dart SDK installed along with Flutter.

3. **Android Studio (or an Emulator):** To run and test your Flutter app on Android devices, you'll need Android Studio with the Android Emulator. Alternatively, you can use physical Android devices for testing.

4. **Xcode (Mac only):** If you're developing for iOS, you'll need Xcode installed on your Mac.

## Setting up the Project:

1. **Create a New Flutter Project:**
   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Run the following command to create a new Flutter project:
   ```
   flutter create fintech_app_getx
   ```

2. **Add Getx Dependency:**
   Open the `pubspec.yaml` file in your project's root directory and add the Getx dependency under `dependencies`:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     get: ^4.0.0  # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   After adding the Getx dependency, save the `pubspec.yaml` file and run the following command in the terminal to install the dependencies:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Project Structure and Organization:

Your "fintech_app_getx" project should follow the GETX Structurer Design Pattern. Here's a recommended project structure:

```
fintech_app_getx/
|-- lib/
|----- data/
|            |-- models/       # Data Models
|            |-- services/     # Business Services and APIs
|----- routes/
|            |-- app_pages.dart
|            |-- app_routes.
|----- widgets
|            |-- invest        # Bottom Navbar Pages.
|                    |-- ..._widget.dart
|----- modules/
Injection
|            |-- bindings/     # Bindings for Dependency 
Business Logic
|            |-- controllers/  # Getx Controllers and
|            |
|            |-- views/        # UI Views and Widgets
|----- theme_data.dart # Contains Global Theme
|----- colors_const.dart #Colors Global App Const
|----- main.dart     # App Entry Point
|-- pubspec.yaml      # Flutter Dependencies Configuration
|-- ...
```

## Getting Started with Coding:

1. **Creating a Binding:**
   Start by creating a binding for a specific route. Bindings handle the injection of dependencies and setup before a route is navigated to. Example:
   ```dart
   import 'package:get/get.dart';

   class HomeBinding extends Bindings {
     @override
     void dependencies() {
       // Inject dependencies for the home view here
       // For example: Get.put(()=> MyController());
       // You can also use Get.lazyPut<Controller>(()=> Controller.constructor())
       // or Get.putAsync<Controller>(() async => Controller.constructor()). 
       // The create method ensures adherence to the SOLID principles by returning
       // a Future<void> for . 
       // putAsync and void for lazyPut.
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Creating a Controller:**
   Controllers manage the business logic for your views. Create a controller for a specific view like this:
   ```dart
   import 'package:get/get.dart';

   class HomeController extends GetxController {
     // Your controller logic here
   }
   ```

3. **Using Getx for State Management:**
   Getx provides a simple yet powerful way to manage your app's state. Use `GetX` or `Obx` widgets to bind your UI to the controller's state.

4. **Navigating between Views:**
   Use `Get.to()` or `Get.off()` to navigate between views. Pass the corresponding binding if needed:
   ```dart
   Get.to(() => HomeView(), binding: HomeBinding());
   ```

## Running Your App:

To run your Flutter app, use the following command in the terminal:

```
flutter run
```

This will launch your app on either an Android emulator or a connected physical device, depending on your configuration.

Congratulations! You've now set up your Flutter project with Getx and are ready to start building your fintech app with advanced UI customization and effective state management.

Remember to refer to the official [Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs) and [Getx documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/get) for more detailed information and examples as you progress with your project. Happy coding!
